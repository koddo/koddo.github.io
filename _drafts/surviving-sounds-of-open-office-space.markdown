Ever heard of misophonia?

<!--more-->

If not, imagine working with people who clear their throat every single minute, like on clock. I had co-workers who don't mind this around them, they don't hear it somehow. I do. There was a guy who made that loud sound hundreds of times a day, every day. Heard of chinese water torture? He laughed me in my face when I asked him politely a couple of times to reduce loundess and frequency. I had to move to another floor, I couldn't handle that.

But that's a severe case. Usually there's a background office noise my brain can't filter out and my productivity goes down. I have a good hearing and I hear everything, I get distracted by sounds easily. People don't even try to talk to each other or on their phones a bit quieter. They open and close doors like they want to express their emotions, good or bad. They don't care to use headphones when watching a video. They drink coffee with unbearable slurp. And nothing can be done, people don't understand words. Friendly humor helps sometimes, but usually doesn't.

And I'm not alone with this problem. You can find many discussions of negative sides of open offices plans. But today I'd like to share how I survive all of that.

Next time let's talk about people who don't shower and don't brush their teeth. Unfortunately, I have to breath to live.
